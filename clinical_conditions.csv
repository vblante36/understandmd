atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.

During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people, AFib may have no symptoms. But AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness.
Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke.
Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals.
A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.","Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a condition where the heart beats in an uneven and often very fast way. It happens when the upper parts of the heart beat out of sync with the lower parts, making the heartbeat feel jumpy or irregular. This can cause blood clots to form, which may lead to a stroke — when blood flow to the brain is blocked.
Some people don’t feel any symptoms, but others might notice a racing heart, shortness of breath, or dizziness.
AFib can come and go or last a long time. Even though it isn’t always dangerous by itself, it needs treatment to avoid serious problems. Doctors might use medicine, electric shocks, or special procedures to help the heart beat normally again."
aneurysm,"An aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm can break open. This is called a rupture. A ruptured aneurysm causes bleeding inside the body. It often leads to death. Some aneurysms cause no symptoms. You might not know you have an aneurysm even if it is large. Aneurysms can form in several parts of the body, including:
The body's main artery, called the aorta (aortic aneurysm).
The part of the aorta that passes through the belly area (abdominal aortic aneurysm).
The part of the aorta that passes through the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm).
Blood vessels that send blood to the brain (brain aneurysm).
Blood vessels in other parts of the body, such as the legs, groin or neck (peripheral aneurysm).
Some small aneurysms have a low risk of rupture. To determine the risk of an aneurysm rupture, a healthcare professional considers:
Your symptoms.
Your medical history.
Your family's medical history.
The size, shape and location of the aneurysm.
Some people with aneurysms only need regular health checkups and imaging tests. If an aneurysm breaks open, emergency treatment is needed. Treatment may involve open surgery or a less-invasive treatment called endovascular surgery.","An aneurysm is a bulge or balloon-like area in a blood vessel. It can happen in different parts of the body, like the brain, chest, belly, or legs. If the aneurysm gets too big, it can burst and cause serious bleeding inside the body.
Some people don’t feel anything, even if the aneurysm is large. But if it bursts, it’s a medical emergency.
Doctors decide how risky it is based on its size, shape, and where it is in the body. Some aneurysms just need regular checkups, but others may need surgery or a less invasive procedure to fix them before they break open."
Bell's palsy,"Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. Often the weakness is short-term and improves over weeks. The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop. Smiles are one-sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close. Bell's palsy also is known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause. It can occur at any age. The exact cause is not known. Experts think it's caused by swelling and irritation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Bell's palsy could be caused by a reaction that occurs after a viral infection.
Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life. Rarely, Bell's palsy occurs more than once.","Bell’s palsy causes sudden weakness on one side of the face. This can make half of the face look droopy, and it might be hard to smile or close one eye.
Doctors think it happens when a nerve in the face gets swollen, often after a virus.
It can happen at any age and usually gets better on its own in a few weeks or months. Some people recover completely, while others may have small, lasting effects. In rare cases, it can happen more than once."
bronchitis,"Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes. These tubes carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may start suddenly and be short term (acute) or start gradually and become long term (chronic). Acute bronchitis, which often develops from a cold or other respiratory infection, is very common. Also called a chest cold, acute bronchitis usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks.
Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. If you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).","Bronchitis is when the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs get swollen and irritated. This makes it harder to breathe and often causes a cough with thick mucus. It can be short-term (called acute bronchitis), which usually comes from a cold and gets better in about a week — though the cough may last longer.
Chronic bronchitis is more serious and lasts a long time. It’s often caused by smoking and can make breathing harder over time. People with repeated bronchitis may have a condition called COPD. Treatment depends on the type, but rest, fluids, and avoiding smoke can help."
calciphylaxis,"Calciphylaxis (kal-sih-fuh-LAK-sis) is a rare, serious disease. It involves a buildup of calcium in small blood vessels of fat tissues and skin.
Calciphylaxis symptoms include blood clots, lumps under the skin and painful open sores called ulcers. If an ulcer becomes infected, it can be life-threatening.
The exact cause of calciphylaxis isn't clear. But people with the disease usually have kidney failure. That's a condition in which the kidneys no longer work as they should. Often, these same people also have received kidney failure treatments such as dialysis or a kidney transplant. Calciphylaxis can happen in people without kidney disease too.
Calciphylaxis treatments include various medicines, procedures and surgery. Treatment can help prevent blood clots and infections, reduce calcium buildups, heal sores, and ease pain.","Calciphylaxis is a rare and serious condition where calcium builds up in small blood vessels in the skin and fat. This can lead to painful lumps or open sores that may become infected. It’s most common in people with kidney failure, especially those on dialysis, but it can happen in others too.
The cause isn’t fully known. If not treated, it can be life-threatening. Treatments focus on reducing calcium buildup, healing sores, and preventing infection. Medicine, wound care, and sometimes surgery are used to manage the condition."
cataracts,"A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye, which is typically clear. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car at night or see the expression on a friend's face. Most cataracts develop slowly and don't disturb eyesight early on. But with time, cataracts will eventually affect vision.
At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help deal with cataracts. But if impaired vision affects usual activities, cataract surgery might be needed. Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure.","A cataract is when the clear lens in your eye becomes cloudy, like looking through a foggy window. This can make it harder to read, drive at night, or see faces clearly. Cataracts often develop slowly and may not affect your vision at first.
In the early stages, brighter lights or new glasses might help. But if your vision gets worse and affects daily life, surgery may be needed. Cataract surgery is common and usually safe, and it replaces the cloudy lens with a clear one."
diabetes ,"Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel.
The main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems.
Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after the baby is born.","Diabetes is a group of conditions that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is your body’s main source of energy, especially for the muscles and brain. In diabetes, sugar builds up in the blood because the body doesn’t make or use insulin properly.
There are different types: type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetes (during pregnancy). Some cases, like prediabetes, can be reversed with healthy changes. If left untreated, diabetes can cause serious problems like heart disease or kidney damage. Treatment usually includes a healthy diet, exercise, and sometimes medication or insulin."
dysarthria,"Dysarthria happens when the muscles used for speech are weak or are hard to control. Dysarthria often causes slurred or slow speech that can be difficult to understand.
Common causes of dysarthria include conditions that affect the nervous system or that cause facial paralysis. These conditions may cause tongue or throat muscle weakness. Certain medicines also can cause dysarthria.
Treating the underlying cause of dysarthria may improve your speech. You also may need speech therapy. For dysarthria caused by prescription medicines, changing or stopping the medicines may help.","Dysarthria is a speech problem that happens when the muscles used for talking are weak or hard to control. It can cause speech to sound slurred, slow, or hard to understand. It’s often caused by nerve or brain conditions, or sometimes by certain medications.
Getting treatment for the cause may help speech improve. Many people also benefit from speech therapy. If medicine is the reason, changing the medication may help."
Ectropion,"Ectropion (ek-TROH-pee-on) is a condition in which your eyelid turns outward. This leaves the inner eyelid surface exposed and prone to irritation.
Ectropion is more common in older adults, and it generally affects only the lower eyelid. In severe ectropion, the entire length of the eyelid is turned out. In less severe ectropion, only one segment of the eyelid sags away from the eye.

Artificial tears and lubricating ointments can help relieve symptoms of ectropion. But usually surgery is needed to fully correct the condition.","Ectropion is a condition where the lower eyelid turns outward, leaving the inner part of the eyelid exposed. This can cause dryness, irritation, or watery eyes because the eye isn’t fully protected. It mostly affects older adults and usually only happens in one eye.
In mild cases, just a small part of the eyelid droops. In severe cases, the whole lower eyelid may turn out.
Eye drops and ointments can help with symptoms, but surgery is usually needed to fix the eyelid and protect the eye."
Endocarditis,"Endocarditis is a life-threatening inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium.
Endocarditis is usually caused by an infection. Bacteria, fungi or other germs get into the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart. Things that make you more likely to get endocarditis are artificial heart valves, damaged heart valves or other heart defects.
Without quick treatment, endocarditis can damage or destroy the heart valves. Treatments for endocarditis include medications and surgery.
Endocarditis occurs when bacteria or other germs enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. The germs then stick to damaged heart valves or damaged heart tissue.","Endocarditis is a serious infection of the inside lining of the heart and its valves. It happens when bacteria or other germs get into the bloodstream and stick to damaged areas in the heart. People with artificial or damaged heart valves are at higher risk.
If not treated quickly, endocarditis can destroy the heart valves and become life-threatening.
Treatment usually includes strong antibiotics and sometimes surgery. Catching and treating it early can help prevent major heart damage."
Fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition that involves widespread body pain. The pain happens along with fatigue. It also can involve issues with sleep, memory and mood. Researchers think that fibromyalgia affects the way the brain and spinal cord process painful and nonpainful signals. That increases your overall sensitivity to pain.
Symptoms often start after a triggering event. Triggers can include injuries, surgery, infections or emotional stress. Or the symptoms can build up over time, with no single event to trigger them.
Women are more likely to get fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have:
Headaches.
Jaw and facial pain due to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.
Irritable bowel syndrome.
Anxiety.
Depression.
There's no cure for fibromyalgia. But medicines and other treatments can help control the symptoms. Exercise, talk therapy and techniques that lower stress also may help.","Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition that causes widespread pain all over the body. It often comes with fatigue, sleep problems, and issues with memory or mood. Experts believe it affects how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals, making you more sensitive to pain.
Symptoms can start after a physical or emotional event, or they may appear slowly over time.
Fibromyalgia is more common in women and often comes with other problems like headaches, jaw pain, stomach issues, anxiety, or depression.
There’s no cure, but medicine, gentle exercise, therapy, and stress-reduction techniques can help manage symptoms."
Folliculitis,"Folliculitis is a common skin condition that happens when hair follicles become inflamed. It's often caused by an infection with bacteria. At first it may look like small pimples around the tiny pockets from where each hair grows (hair follicles).
The condition can be itchy, sore and embarrassing. The infection can spread and turn into crusty sores.
Mild folliculitis will likely heal without scarring in a few days with basic self-care. More-serious or repeat infections may need prescription medicine. Left untreated, severe infections can cause permanent hair loss and scarring.
Certain types of folliculitis are known as hot tub rash and barber's itch.","Folliculitis is a skin condition where the hair follicles get inflamed, usually from a bacterial infection. It can look like small pimples around the base of hairs and may be itchy or painful.
In mild cases, it goes away in a few days with basic care, like cleaning the area and avoiding shaving or tight clothing.
More serious or repeat infections may need prescription creams or pills. If left untreated, it can lead to scars or permanent hair loss.
There are special names for certain types, like “hot tub rash” or “barber’s itch.”"
Gallstones,"Gallstones are hardened deposits of digestive fluid that can form in your gallbladder. Your gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of your abdomen, just beneath your liver. The gallbladder holds a digestive fluid called bile that's released into your small intestine.
Gallstones range in size from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball. Some people develop just one gallstone, while others develop many gallstones at the same time.
People who experience symptoms from their gallstones usually require gallbladder removal surgery. Gallstones that don't cause any signs and symptoms typically don't need treatment.
","Gallstones are hard lumps that form in the gallbladder, a small organ under your liver that helps with digestion. They’re made from digestive fluids and can be as small as a grain of sand or as big as a golf ball.
Some people have just one gallstone, while others have many. Most people don’t feel anything, but if a gallstone blocks a bile duct, it can cause pain, nausea, or digestive problems.
If gallstones cause symptoms, the usual treatment is to remove the gallbladder with surgery. If there are no symptoms, treatment might not be needed."
Glaucoma,"Glaucoma is an eye condition that damages the optic nerve. This damage can lead to vision loss or blindness. The optic nerve sends visual information from your eye to the brain and is vital for good vision. Damage to the optic nerve is often related to high pressure in the eye. But glaucoma can happen even with typical eye pressure. Glaucoma can happen at any age but is more common in older adults. It is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60.
Many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs. The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is in its later stages.
It's important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure. If glaucoma is found early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented. If you have glaucoma, you'll need treatment or monitoring for the rest of your life.","Glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the optic nerve, which carries signals from your eyes to your brain. This damage can lead to vision loss or blindness, especially if it’s not caught early. It’s often caused by high pressure inside the eye, but not always.
Glaucoma is more common in older adults, and many people don’t notice symptoms until the disease is advanced. That’s why regular eye exams are important — they can help catch it before vision is lost.
If caught early, treatment can slow or prevent vision loss. Most people with glaucoma need ongoing treatment or monitoring for life."
Hashimoto's disease,"Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid gland. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that help regulate many functions in the body.
An autoimmune disorder is an illness caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissues. In Hashimoto's disease, immune-system cells lead to the death of the thyroid's hormone-producing cells. The disease usually results in a decline in hormone production (hypothyroidism).
Although anyone can develop Hashimoto's disease, it's most common among middle-aged women. The primary treatment is thyroid hormone replacement.
Hashimoto's disease is also known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis.","Hashimoto’s disease is an autoimmune condition that affects the thyroid, a gland in the neck that helps control energy and other body functions. In this disease, the immune system attacks the thyroid, causing it to stop making enough hormones — a condition called hypothyroidism.
This can lead to tiredness, weight gain, feeling cold, and other symptoms. Hashimoto’s is most common in middle-aged women, but it can affect anyone.
There’s no cure, but it’s treatable with thyroid hormone pills, which help the body work normally again."
Heartburn,"Heartburn is a burning pain in your chest, just behind your breastbone. The pain is often worse after eating, in the evening, or when lying down or bending over.
Occasional heartburn is common and no cause for alarm. Most people can manage the discomfort of heartburn on their own with lifestyle changes and nonprescription medications.
Heartburn that is more frequent or interferes with your daily routine may be a symptom of a more serious condition that requires medical care.","Heartburn is a burning pain in the chest, usually behind the breastbone. It often happens after eating or when lying down and is caused by stomach acid moving up into the esophagus.
Occasional heartburn is common and usually not serious. Most people can manage it with lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medicine.
But if heartburn happens often or interferes with daily life, it could be a sign of a more serious condition and should be checked by a doctor."
Idiopathic hypersomnia,"Idiopathic hypersomnia is a condition that causes people to be very sleepy during the day even after a full night of sleep. People with the condition have trouble waking up from sleep. They also may wake up confused and disoriented. Naps typically don't lead to feeling refreshed. Idiopathic hypersomnia is not common, and the cause of the condition is not known.
The need to sleep can strike at any time, including when driving a car or working. This makes idiopathic hypersomnia potentially dangerous.
The condition often develops slowly over time. Diagnosing idiopathic hypersomnia requires ruling out more common sleep conditions. Treatment aims to control symptoms with medicine.","Idiopathic hypersomnia is a condition where people feel extremely sleepy during the day, even after getting a full night of sleep. They may also have a hard time waking up and feel confused or groggy.
Naps don’t help, and sleepiness can happen at dangerous times, like while driving. The cause is unknown, and the condition is rare.
It usually develops slowly over time. Doctors diagnose it by ruling out other sleep problems. There’s no cure, but medication can help manage symptoms."
Indigestion,"Indigestion — also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach — is discomfort in your upper abdomen. Indigestion describes certain symptoms, such as belly pain and a feeling of fullness soon after you start eating, rather than a specific disease. Indigestion can also be a symptom of other digestive disorders. Although indigestion is common, each person may experience indigestion in a slightly different way. Symptoms of indigestion may be felt occasionally or as often as daily.
Indigestion may often be relieved with lifestyle changes and medicines.","Indigestion, also called dyspepsia or an upset stomach, is discomfort in the upper belly. It might feel like pain, bloating, or getting full too fast while eating.
It’s a common problem and can happen once in a while or more often. Some people feel it daily, while others only get it occasionally.
Indigestion can be caused by food, stress, or other medical problems. It’s often managed with diet changes, stress management, and medicine."
Keratoconus,"Keratoconus (ker-uh-toe-KOH-nus) is an eye condition in which the clear, dome-shaped front of the eye, called the cornea, gets thinner, steeper and bulges outward into a cone shape.
A cone-shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes. However, it can affect one eye more than the other. It generally begins to affect people between the late teens and 30 years of age. The condition may progress slowly for 10 years or longer.

In the early stages of keratoconus, you might be able to correct vision problems with glasses or soft contact lenses. Later, you may have to be fitted with rigid, gas permeable contact lenses or other types of lenses, such as scleral lenses. If your condition gets worse, you may need a cornea transplant.
A procedure called corneal collagen cross-linking may help to slow or stop keratoconus from progressing, possibly preventing the need for a future cornea transplant. This treatment may be offered in addition to the vision correction options above.","Keratoconus is an eye condition where the front part of the eye, called the cornea, becomes thin and bulges into a cone shape. This causes blurry vision and sensitivity to light.
It usually starts between the late teens and early 30s and may get worse over 10 years or more. Glasses or soft lenses may help early on, but many people need special hard lenses as the condition gets worse.
In more serious cases, a cornea transplant may be needed. A procedure called corneal cross-linking can also help slow or stop the condition from getting worse."
Klinefelter syndrome,"Klinefelter syndrome is a common condition that results when a person assigned male at birth has an extra copy of the X sex chromosome instead of the typical XY. Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs before birth, but it often isn't diagnosed until adulthood. Klinefelter syndrome may affect testicular growth. This results in smaller testicles, which can lead to making less of the hormone testosterone. The syndrome also may cause smaller muscle mass, less body and facial hair, and extra breast tissue. The effects of Klinefelter syndrome vary, and not everyone has the same symptoms.
Most people with Klinefelter syndrome produce little or no sperm, but assisted reproductive procedures may make it possible for some people with Klinefelter syndrome to have biological children.","Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that happens when someone assigned male at birth has an extra X chromosome. This affects how the body grows and develops, especially in puberty. It may cause smaller testicles, lower testosterone levels, and changes like less facial hair or more breast tissue.
Not everyone with Klinefelter syndrome has the same symptoms. It’s often not diagnosed until adulthood.
Many people with this condition have low or no sperm, but fertility treatments may help some have biological children. Support and hormone therapy can help with symptoms."
Laryngitis,"Laryngitis is an inflammation of your voice box (larynx) from overuse, irritation or infection.
Inside the larynx are your vocal cords — two folds of mucous membrane covering muscle and cartilage. Normally, your vocal cords open and close smoothly, forming sounds through their movement and vibration.
How speech occurs
Speech occurs when air flows from the lungs, up the windpipe (trachea) and through the voice box (larynx). This causes the vocal cords to vibrate, creating sound. Sound is shaped into words by the muscles controlling the soft palate, tongue and lips.

Vocal cords open and closed
Vocal cords open when you breathe and then close to produce sound when vibrating together.
But with laryngitis, your vocal cords become inflamed or irritated. This makes the vocal cords swell, which distorts the sounds produced by air passing over them. As a result, your voice sounds hoarse. In some cases of laryngitis, your voice can become almost undetectable.
Laryngitis may be short-lived (acute) or long lasting (chronic). Most cases of laryngitis are triggered by a temporary viral infection and aren't serious. Persistent hoarseness can sometimes signal a more serious underlying medical condition.","Laryngitis is when the voice box (larynx) gets swollen, usually from overuse, a cold, or irritation. The vocal cords inside the larynx help you speak by vibrating when air passes over them. When they’re swollen, your voice may sound hoarse or even disappear.
Laryngitis can be short-term (from a virus) or long-lasting (from smoking or overuse). Most cases go away on their own in a few days.
If hoarseness lasts a long time, it could be a sign of another problem and should be checked by a doctor."
Leukemia,"Leukemia is cancer of the body's blood-forming tissues, including the bone marrow and the lymphatic system.
Many types of leukemia exist. Some forms of leukemia are more common in children. Other forms of leukemia occur mostly in adults.
Leukemia usually involves the white blood cells. Your white blood cells are potent infection fighters — they normally grow and divide in an orderly way, as your body needs them. But in people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces an excessive amount of abnormal white blood cells, which don't function properly.
Treatment for leukemia can be complex — depending on the type of leukemia and other factors. But there are strategies and resources that can help make your treatment successful.","Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects how your body makes blood, especially white blood cells. In leukemia, the body makes too many abnormal white blood cells that don’t work the way they should.
There are different types, some more common in children and others in adults.
Symptoms and treatments can vary, but care usually involves medications, chemotherapy, and sometimes bone marrow transplants. With the right treatment, many people live full lives."
Malaria,"Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills.
While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries. Each year nearly 290 million people are infected with malaria, and more than 400,000 people die of the disease.
To reduce malaria infections, world health programs distribute preventive drugs and insecticide-treated bed nets to protect people from mosquito bites. The World Health Organization has recommended a malaria vaccine for use in children who live in countries with high numbers of malaria cases.
Protective clothing, bed nets and insecticides can protect you while traveling. You also can take preventive medicine before, during and after a trip to a high-risk area. Many malaria parasites have developed resistance to common drugs used to treat the disease.","Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that spreads through the bite of an infected mosquito. It causes high fever, chills, and feeling very sick.
Malaria is rare in places like the U.S. but still common in many tropical countries. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people die from it.
You can help prevent malaria by using bug spray, bed nets, and taking preventive medicine when traveling to high-risk areas. There’s also a vaccine for young children in high-risk regions. Treatment is available, but some forms of malaria are harder to treat due to drug resistance."
Measles,"Measles, also called rubeola, was once a common childhood illness. It's caused by a virus that spreads easily through the air and settles on surfaces. A vaccine can prevent measles infection.
Most people recover from measles in about 10 days. It usually doesn't cause long-term medical issues. But measles can be serious and even deadly. This is especially true for children younger than age 5 and people with severely weakened immune systems.
Measles is treated by managing symptoms and preventing complications.
Get a measles vaccine when recommended to keep the virus from spreading. Because of vaccination, measles hasn't been common in the United States for more than two decades. Often, measles cases in the U.S. come from outside the country. Outbreaks are more common among people who are not vaccinated.
Measles illness causes a blotchy rash. It may be shades of red, purple or brown depending on your skin color. The rash most often shows up first on the face and behind the ears. The rash then spreads to the chest and back and finally to the feet.","Measles is a viral infection that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces. It usually starts with a fever and cough, followed by a blotchy rash that spreads from the face to the rest of the body.
Most people recover in about 10 days, but it can be dangerous — especially for young children and people with weak immune systems.
There is no cure, but symptoms can be managed. The measles vaccine is very effective at preventing the disease and has made it rare in many countries. Outbreaks mostly happen in areas with low vaccination rates."
Nearsightedness,"Nearsightedness is a common vision condition in which close objects look clear but far objects look blurry. The medical term for nearsightedness is myopia. Myopia happens when the shape of the eye — or the shape of certain parts of the eye — causes light rays to bend or refract. Light rays that should be focused on nerve tissues at the back of the eye, called the retina, are focused in front of the retina instead. Nearsightedness usually develops during childhood and adolescence. Typically, it becomes more stable between the ages of 20 and 40. It tends to run in families.
A basic eye exam can confirm nearsightedness. You can correct the blurry vision with eyeglasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery.","Nearsightedness, or myopia, is a vision problem where you can see things up close clearly, but things far away look blurry. It happens when the eye’s shape causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it.
Myopia usually starts in childhood or teenage years and tends to run in families.
It can be diagnosed with a basic eye exam. You can correct it with glasses, contact lenses, or laser surgery."
Neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma is a cancer that starts in cells called neuroblasts. Neuroblasts are immature nerve cells. They are found in several areas of the body.
Neuroblastoma most often starts in the neuroblasts in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney. The glands make hormones that control important functions in the body. Other parts of the body that have neuroblasts and can get neuroblastoma include the spine, belly, chest and neck.
Neuroblastoma usually affects children age 5 or younger. Symptoms vary, depending on where it occurs in the body.
Some forms of neuroblastoma may go away on their own. Other forms of neuroblastoma need treatment. Treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and bone marrow transplant. Your child's healthcare team will select the neuroblastoma treatments that are best for your child.","Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that starts in immature nerve cells called neuroblasts. It usually begins in the adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys, but it can also appear in the chest, belly, spine, or neck.
This cancer mostly affects young children, especially those under age 5. Symptoms depend on where the tumor is in the body.
Some cases go away on their own, but others need treatment, which may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, or a bone marrow transplant. Doctors choose the best treatment plan based on the child’s case."
Oligodendroglioma,"Oligodendroglioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The growth, called a tumor, begins in cells called oligodendrocytes. These cells make a substance that protects nerve cells and helps with the flow of electrical signals in the brain and spinal cord. Oligodendroglioma is most common in adults, but it can happen at any age. Symptoms include seizures, headaches, and weakness or disability in a part of the body. Where this happens in the body depends on which parts of the brain or spinal cord are affected by the tumor.
Treatment is with surgery, when possible. Sometimes surgery can't be done if the tumor is in a place that makes it hard to reach with surgical tools. Other treatments may be needed if the tumor can't be removed or if it's likely to come back after surgery.","Oligodendroglioma is a brain or spinal cord tumor that starts in cells called oligodendrocytes. These cells help protect nerve signals in the brain and spinal cord.
This type of tumor is rare and slow-growing, and more common in adults. It can cause seizures, headaches, or weakness depending on where it is in the nervous system.
Treatment often starts with surgery, but if the tumor can’t be safely removed or is likely to come back, radiation or chemotherapy may be used."
Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. It happens when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones wears down over time.
Although osteoarthritis can damage any joint, the condition most commonly affects joints in the hands, knees, hips and spine.
Osteoarthritis symptoms can usually be managed, although the damage to joints can't be reversed. Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and receiving certain treatments might slow progression of the disease and help improve pain and joint function.","Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It happens when the cartilage that cushions your joints wears down over time. This can cause pain, stiffness, and make it harder to move.
It often affects the hands, knees, hips, and spine. The damage can’t be reversed, but the symptoms can be managed.
Staying active, keeping a healthy weight, and using medicine or physical therapy can help reduce pain and improve joint movement."
Pancreatitis,"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Inflammation is immune system activity that can cause swelling, pain, and changes in how an organ or tissues work.
The pancreas is a long, flat gland that's tucked behind the stomach. The pancreas helps the body digest food and regulates blood sugars.

Pancreatitis can be an acute condition. This means it appears suddenly and generally lasts a short time. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition. The damage to the pancreas can get worse over time.
Acute pancreatitis may improve on its own. More-serious disease requires treatment in a hospital and can cause life-threatening complications.","Pancreatitis is when the pancreas becomes swollen and painful. The pancreas is a gland behind your stomach that helps digest food and control blood sugar.
It can happen suddenly (acute) or last a long time (chronic). Acute cases may go away on their own, but chronic ones can get worse over time.
Symptoms may include severe belly pain, nausea, and vomiting. Some cases need hospital care, especially if there are serious complications."
Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder of the nervous system that worsens over time. The nervous system is a network of nerve cells that controls many parts of the body, including movement.
Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand or sometimes a foot or the jaw. Tremor is common in Parkinson's disease. But the disorder also may cause stiffness, slowing of movement and trouble with balance that raises the risk of falls.
In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Symptoms get worse over time.
Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medicines may help symptoms get better. Sometimes a healthcare professional may suggest surgery to help control parts of the brain. This surgery may help lessen symptoms.","Parkinson’s disease is a nervous system disorder that affects movement. It usually starts slowly, with symptoms like a tremor in one hand or stiffness in the body.
Over time, it can cause slower movement, poor balance, and changes in speech or facial expression.
There is no cure, but medicines can help reduce symptoms. In some cases, surgery to target brain areas may also help."
Renal artery stenosis,"Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or more arteries that carry blood to your kidneys (renal arteries).
Narrowing of the arteries prevents enough oxygen-rich blood from reaching your kidneys. Your kidneys need adequate blood flow to help filter waste products and remove excess fluids. Reduced blood flow to your kidneys may injure kidney tissue and increase blood pressure throughout your body.","Renal artery stenosis is when the arteries that bring blood to your kidneys become too narrow. This means the kidneys don’t get enough blood and can’t work properly.
It can lead to kidney damage and high blood pressure. If not treated, the kidneys can become injured.
Treatment may involve medications, lifestyle changes, or sometimes procedures to open the narrowed arteries."
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes infections of the lungs and respiratory tract. It's so common that most children have been infected with the virus by age 2. Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-ul) virus can also infect adults.
In adults and older, healthy children, RSV symptoms are mild and typically mimic the common cold. Self-care measures are usually all that's needed to relieve any discomfort.
RSV can cause severe infection in some people, including babies 12 months and younger (infants), especially premature infants, older adults, people with heart and lung disease, or anyone with a weak immune system (immunocompromised).","RSV is a common virus that causes lung and airway infections. Most kids get it by age 2, and in healthy children or adults, it usually feels like a cold.
But RSV can be dangerous for babies, older adults, and people with heart, lung, or immune problems. It may cause serious breathing issues in these groups.
Most people recover with rest and fluids, but hospital care may be needed for high-risk patients."
Sacroiliitis,"Sacroiliitis (say-kroe-il-e-I-tis) is a painful condition that affects one or both sacroiliac joints. These joints sit where the lower spine and pelvis meet. Sacroiliitis can cause pain and stiffness in the buttocks or lower back, and the pain might go down one or both legs. Standing or sitting for a long time or climbing stairs can make the pain worse. Sacroiliitis can be hard to diagnose. It can be mistaken for other causes of low back pain. It's been linked to a group of diseases that cause inflammatory arthritis of the spine. Treatment might involve physical therapy and medicines.","Sacroiliitis is when the joints that connect the lower spine and pelvis become inflamed. It can cause pain in the lower back or buttocks, which may spread down the legs.
Pain often gets worse with standing, sitting too long, or climbing stairs. It can be hard to diagnose and is sometimes mistaken for other types of back pain.
It may be related to arthritis in the spine. Physical therapy, medication, and stretching can help reduce pain and improve movement."
Scoliosis,"Scoliosis is a side-to-side curve of the spine. It's most often diagnosed after age 10 or in the early teen years. The spine can curve to either side and in different parts of the back. Experts don't know the cause of most childhood scoliosis.
Most scoliosis is mild. But some curves get worse as children grow. If the curve gets very bad, scoliosis can cause pain and breathing problems. A bad curve of the spine can push on the lungs and make it hard to breathe.
Healthcare professionals watch growing children who have mild scoliosis with follow-up visits a few times a year. This most often involves X-rays and a physical exam to see if the curve is getting worse. Many people with scoliosis don't need treatment.
Some children may need to wear a brace to stop the curve from getting worse. Others may need surgery to correct the curves.","Scoliosis is when the spine curves sideways, usually in the upper or lower back. It’s most often found in kids or teens after age 10. Many cases are mild, but some curves get worse as a child grows.
If the curve is severe, it can cause pain and even breathing problems by pressing on the lungs.
Doctors usually monitor mild scoliosis with X-rays and checkups. Some children may need to wear a brace to keep the curve from getting worse, and a few may need surgery to straighten the spine."
Tay-Sachs disease,"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder passed from parents to child. It's caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances. These fatty substances, called gangliosides, build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells. In the most common and severe form of Tay-Sachs disease, signs and symptoms start to show up at about 3 to 6 months of age. As the disease progresses, development slows and muscles begin to weaken. Over time, this leads to seizures, vision and hearing loss, paralysis, and other major issues. Children with this form of Tay-Sachs disease typically live only a few years.
Less commonly, some children have the juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease and may live into their teen years. Rarely, some adults have a late-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease which is often less severe than forms that begin in childhood.
If you have a family history of Tay-Sachs disease or if you're a member of a high-risk group and plan to have children, health care providers strongly recommend genetic testing and genetic counseling.","Tay-Sachs is a rare genetic disorder that mostly affects babies. It’s caused by a missing enzyme that normally breaks down fatty substances in the brain and spinal cord. Without it, these substances build up and cause serious brain damage.
Babies with the most common form usually show signs around 3–6 months, including slowed development, muscle weakness, and later, seizures and blindness.
There is no cure, and most children with the severe form live only a few years. There are less severe forms in teens or adults. Genetic testing and counseling are recommended for people at high risk."
Tetanus,"Tetanus is a serious disease of the nervous system caused by a toxin-producing bacterium. The disease causes muscle contractions, particularly of your jaw and neck muscles. Tetanus is commonly known as lockjaw.
Severe complications of tetanus can be life-threatening. There's no cure for tetanus. Treatment focuses on managing symptoms and complications until the effects of the tetanus toxin resolve.
Because of the widespread use of vaccines, cases of tetanus are rare in the United States and other parts of the developed world. The disease remains a threat to people who aren't up to date on their vaccinations. It's more common in developing countries.","Tetanus is a serious disease caused by a toxin from bacteria. It causes painful muscle tightening, especially in the jaw and neck, which is why it’s often called lockjaw.
It can lead to dangerous complications and even death. There’s no cure, but treatment helps manage symptoms while the body heals.
Tetanus is rare in places with good vaccination programs, but it’s still a threat for people who are not vaccinated. A tetanus shot is the best way to prevent it."
Ulcerative colitis,"Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation and sores, called ulcers, in part of the digestive tract. Ulcerative colitis (UL-sur-uh-tiv koe-LIE-tis) affects the innermost lining of the large intestine, called the colon, and rectum. Symptoms usually develop over time, rather than coming on suddenly.
Ulcerative colitis can weaken the body and can sometimes lead to life-threatening complications. While it has no known cure, treatment can greatly reduce and relieve symptoms of the disease. It also may bring about long-term remission.","Ulcerative colitis is a long-term condition that causes inflammation and sores (ulcers) in the large intestine and rectum. It can lead to symptoms like stomach pain, diarrhea, and bleeding.
The disease develops slowly and may have periods where symptoms come and go. It has no cure, but treatments like medicine and diet changes can ease symptoms and prevent flare-ups.
In some cases, it may lead to serious complications and need surgery."
Uveitis,"Uveitis is a form of eye inflammation. It affects the middle layer of tissue in the eye wall (uvea).
Uveitis (u-vee-I-tis) warning signs often come on suddenly and get worse quickly. They include eye redness, pain and blurred vision. The condition can affect one or both eyes, and it can affect people of all ages, even children.
Possible causes of uveitis are infection, injury, or an autoimmune or inflammatory disease. Many times a cause can't be identified.
Uveitis can be serious, leading to permanent vision loss. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent complications and preserve your vision.","Uveitis is inflammation inside the eye, affecting the middle layer called the uvea. It often causes redness, eye pain, blurry vision, and can come on suddenly.
It can affect one or both eyes and happen at any age. Uveitis may be caused by infections, injuries, or immune system problems, but sometimes the cause is unknown.
If not treated early, it can lead to permanent vision loss. Quick diagnosis and medications can help prevent damage and protect vision."
Ventricular fibrillation,"Ventricular fibrillation is a type of irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). During ventricular fibrillation, the lower heart chambers contract in a very rapid and uncoordinated manner. As a result, the heart doesn't pump blood to the rest of the body.
Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. It's the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death.
Emergency treatment for ventricular fibrillation includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Medications, implanted devices or surgery may be recommended to prevent episodes of ventricular fibrillation.
Ventricular fibrillation may also be called VFib, V-fib or VF.","Ventricular fibrillation is a dangerous heart rhythm problem where the heart’s lower chambers beat fast and out of control. This stops the heart from pumping blood to the body.
It’s a medical emergency and a leading cause of sudden cardiac death.
Immediate treatment includes CPR and shocks to the heart using an AED (defibrillator). Long-term care may include medicines, implanted devices, or surgery to prevent future episodes."
Vasculitis,"Vasculitis involves swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of blood vessels. The inflammation can cause the walls of the blood vessels to thicken. This thickening can narrow the vessels. If the narrowing restricts blood flow, it can damage organs and tissues.
There are many types of vasculitis. Most of them are rare. Vasculitis might affect just one organ or several. The condition can be short-term or long lasting.
Vasculitis can affect anyone. But some types are more common among people in certain age groups. Some types may improve without treatment. Most types need treatment with medicines to control the inflammation and prevent flares.","Vasculitis is when the blood vessels get inflamed, which can cause the walls to thicken and narrow. This reduces blood flow and can damage organs and tissues.
There are many types, and most are rare. Some affect just one area, while others involve many parts of the body.
Symptoms vary, and some forms may improve without treatment. Others need medications to control the immune system and reduce inflammation."
Whooping cough,"Whooping cough is an illness that can spread easily. It's also called pertussis. An infection with bacteria causes it. Many people with the illness get a serious hacking cough. Breathing in after coughing often causes a high-pitched noise that sounds like a ""whoop.""
Before the vaccine for pertussis came out, whooping cough was thought of as a childhood disease. Today, whooping cough mainly affects children too young to have gotten all their shots of the vaccine. The illness also tends to affect teenagers and adults whose protection from the vaccine has faded.
Deaths linked with whooping cough are rare. Most often, they occur in infants. But pregnant people can help protect their babies by getting a booster shot of the vaccine during pregnancy. Vaccination also is recommended for other people who will have close contact with an infant.","Whooping cough is a bacterial illness that causes a strong cough followed by a high-pitched “whoop” sound when breathing in.
It spreads easily and mostly affects babies and young children, especially if they haven’t had all their vaccines.
Most people recover, but it can be dangerous for infants. A vaccine protects against it, and pregnant people are encouraged to get a booster shot to help protect their newborns.
Vaccination is also important for anyone in close contact with babies."
Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited condition that causes copper levels to build up in several organs, especially the liver, brain and eyes. Most people with Wilson's disease are diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 35. But younger and older people can be affected too.
Copper plays a key role in building healthy nerves, bones, collagen and the skin pigment melanin. You usually take in copper from the food you eat. Your liver produces a substance called bile that removes any extra copper.
But in people with Wilson's disease, copper isn't removed properly and instead builds up. Sometimes it can be life-threatening if it's not treated. When diagnosed early, Wilson's disease is treatable, and many people with the condition live normal lives.","Wilson’s disease is a rare condition that causes too much copper to build up in the body. It mainly affects the liver, brain, and eyes.
Normally, the liver removes extra copper, but in this condition, it doesn’t work properly.
If untreated, copper can build up to dangerous levels and damage organs.
Symptoms can appear anytime between childhood and age 35.
With early diagnosis and proper treatment, people with Wilson’s disease can live normal, healthy lives."
Addison's disease,"Addison's disease is a rare condition that happens when the body doesn't make enough of some hormones. Another name for Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency. With Addison's disease, the adrenal glands make too little of the hormone cortisol. Often, they also make too little of another hormone called aldosterone. Damage to the adrenal glands causes Addison's disease. Symptoms can start slowly. Early symptoms may include extreme tiredness, salt cravings and weight loss.
Addison's disease can affect anyone. Without treatment, it can be life-threatening. Treatment involves taking lab-made hormones to replace those that are missing.","Addison’s disease happens when the body doesn’t make enough important hormones, like cortisol and aldosterone.
These hormones help control energy, blood pressure, and the balance of salt and water.
Early symptoms can include extreme tiredness, weight loss, and craving salty foods.
Without treatment, the condition can be life-threatening, but it’s manageable by taking hormone replacement medicine every day."
Baker cyst,"A Baker cyst is a fluid-filled growth behind the knee. It causes a bulge and a feeling of tightness. Also called a popliteal (pop-luh-TEE-ul) cyst, a Baker cyst sometime causes pain. The pain can get worse when with activity or when fully straightening or bending the knee. A Baker cyst is usually the result of a problem with the knee joint, such as arthritis or a cartilage tear. Both conditions can cause the knee to produce too much fluid.
Although a Baker cyst may cause swelling and discomfort, treating the underlying problem that is causing it usually provides relief.","A Baker cyst is a fluid-filled lump that forms behind the knee. It can cause tightness, swelling, and pain, especially when bending or straightening the leg.
It often happens when there’s a problem inside the knee, like arthritis or a torn cartilage.
The cyst is not dangerous, and many go away on their own.
Treating the underlying knee problem usually helps the cyst shrink or disappear."
Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy is a group of conditions that affect movement and posture. It's caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain, most often before birth.
Symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years and vary from very mild to serious. Children with cerebral palsy may have exaggerated reflexes. The arms, legs and trunk may appear floppy. Or they may have stiff muscles, known as spasticity. Symptoms also can include irregular posture, movements that can't be controlled, a walk that's not steady or some combination of these.
Cerebral palsy may make it hard to swallow. It also can cause eye muscle imbalance, in which the eyes don't focus on the same object. People with the condition might have reduced range of motion in their joints due to muscle stiffness.
The cause of cerebral palsy and its effect on function vary from person to person. Some people with cerebral palsy can walk while others need assistance. Some people have intellectual disabilities, but others do not. Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also might affect some people with cerebral palsy. There is no cure, but treatments can help improve function. The symptoms of cerebral palsy may vary during the child's development, but the condition doesn't get worse. The condition generally stays the same over time.","Cerebral palsy is a group of conditions that affect movement, posture, and muscle control.
It happens when the brain is damaged early in life — often before birth.
Symptoms can range from mild to serious and may include stiff or floppy muscles, trouble walking, or uncontrolled movements.
Some people may also have trouble speaking, seeing, or learning, but not everyone.
There’s no cure, but treatments like physical therapy and support can help improve everyday life."
Diverticulitis,"Diverticulitis is inflammation of irregular bulging pouches in the wall of the large intestine.
Typically, the wall of the large intestine, also called the colon, is smooth. An irregular, bulging pouch in the colon wall is called a diverticulum. Multiple pouches are called diverticula.
Diverticula are common, especially after age 50. They are usually found in the lower part of the colon. Most often, they don't cause problems. The presence of diverticula is called diverticulosis. Diverticulosis isn't a disease condition.
When these pouches become inflamed, the condition is called diverticulitis. Inflammation is immune system activity that increases blood flow and fluids to a site in the body and delivers disease-fighting cells. Inflammation of diverticula can cause severe pain, fever, nausea and changes in your stool habits.
Mild diverticulitis is usually treated with rest, changes in your diet and possibly antibiotics. Severe diverticulitis usually needs antibiotic treatment in the hospital. Surgery may be needed for severe or frequent diverticulitis.","Diverticulitis is when small bulging pouches in the wall of the colon (large intestine) become inflamed or infected.
These pouches are called diverticula and are common in people over 50.
When they get inflamed, it can cause severe belly pain, fever, and nausea.
Mild cases can often be treated with rest, diet changes, and sometimes antibiotics.
Severe cases may require hospital care or even surgery."
Edema,"Edema is swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body's tissues. Edema can affect any part of the body. But it's more likely to show up in the legs and feet.
Medicines and pregnancy can cause edema. It also can be the result of a disease, such as congestive heart failure, kidney disease, venous insufficiency or cirrhosis of the liver.
Wearing compression garments and reducing salt in the diet often relieves edema. When a disease causes edema, the disease needs treatment, as well.","Edema is swelling caused by extra fluid getting trapped in the body’s tissues, often in the legs or feet.
It can happen from medicines, pregnancy, or health conditions like heart or kidney problems.
Wearing compression socks and eating less salt can help.
When a disease causes edema, the disease needs specific treatment to control it."
Ganglion cysts,"Ganglion cysts are lumps that most often appear along the tendons or joints of wrists or hands. They also can occur in ankles and feet. Ganglion cysts are typically round or oval and are filled with a jellylike fluid. They are not cancer.
Small ganglion cysts can be pea-sized. They can change size. Ganglion cysts can be painful if they press on a nearby nerve. Sometimes they affect joint movement.

For a ganglion cyst that causes problems, having a health care provider drain the cyst with a needle might be an option. So might removing the cyst surgically. But if there are no symptoms, no treatment is necessary. Often, the cysts grow and shrink. Some go away on their own.

","Ganglion cysts are non-cancerous lumps that usually appear near joints or tendons, especially in the hands or wrists.
They’re filled with a jelly-like fluid and can change size or go away on their own.
Sometimes they hurt if they press on a nerve or get in the way of joint movement.
If the cyst causes pain or problems, it can be drained or removed.
If there are no symptoms, it often doesn’t need treatment."
Meningitis,"Meningitis is an infection and swelling, called inflammation, of the fluid and membranes around the brain and spinal cord. These membranes are called meninges.
The inflammation from meningitis most often triggers symptoms such as headache, fever and a stiff neck.
Viral infections are the most common cause of meningitis in the United States. Bacteria, parasites and fungi also can cause it. Sometimes meningitis improves in a few weeks without treatment. But meningitis also can cause death. It often needs quick treatment with antibiotics.

Seek medical care right away if you think that you or someone in your family has meningitis. For meningitis caused by bacteria, early treatment can prevent serious complications.","Meningitis is an infection that causes swelling around the brain and spinal cord.
This swelling is called inflammation and can cause fever, headache, and a stiff neck.
It can be caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi.
Some mild cases go away on their own, but bacterial meningitis can be deadly and needs immediate treatment with antibiotics.
If you think someone might have meningitis, it’s important to get medical help right away."
Plantar fasciitis,"Plantar fasciitis (PLAN-tur fas-e-I-tis) is one of the most common causes of heel pain. It involves inflammation of a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of each foot and connects the heel bone to the toes, known as the plantar fascia.
Plantar fasciitis commonly causes stabbing pain that often occurs with your first steps in the morning. As you get up and move, the pain normally decreases, but it might return after long periods of standing or when you stand up after sitting.
The cause of plantar fasciitis is poorly understood. It is more common in runners and in people who are overweight.

","Plantar fasciitis is a common cause of heel pain. It happens when a thick band of tissue along the bottom of your foot, called the plantar fascia, gets inflamed.
The pain often feels sharp and is worst with your first steps in the morning.
It may get better during the day, but it can return after sitting or standing for a long time.
It’s more common in runners and people who are overweight.
Treatments include rest, stretching, special shoes, or other therapies."
