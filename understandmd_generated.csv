atrial fibrillation,"Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is an irregular and often very rapid heart rhythm. An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people, AFib may have no symptoms. But AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness. Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke. Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals. A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.","Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a condition where the heart beats in an uneven and often very fast way. It happens when the upper parts of the heart beat out of sync with the lower parts, making the heartbeat feel jumpy or irregular. This can cause blood clots to form, which may lead to a stroke — when blood flow to the brain is blocked.
Some people don’t feel any symptoms, but others might notice a racing heart, shortness of breath, or dizziness.
AFib can come and go or last a long time. Even though it isn’t always dangerous by itself, it needs treatment to avoid serious problems. Doctors might use medicine, electric shocks, or special procedures to help the heart beat normally again.",Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is when your heart beats very quickly and irregularly.,"- Fast, pounding heartbeat

Term: epilepsy
Description: Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which the brain has repeated seizures. Seizures can affect different parts of the body. They can cause physical symptoms such as shaking, loss of consciousness, confusion, or difficulty speaking or moving. Seizures can also cause emotional or mental symptoms such as anxiety or panic. The exact cause of epilepsy is often unknown, but it can be triggered by certain medications, infections, trauma to the head, or a family history of epilepsy. Some people with epilepsy have no symptoms between seizures, while others have frequent seizures. Epilepsy is not contagious, and it is not a sign of weakness. It is a medical condition that needs proper treatment. Treatment for epilepsy may include medications, therapy, lifestyle changes, or surgery.

aneurysm,"An aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm can break open. This is called a rupture. A ruptured aneurysm causes bleeding inside the body. It often leads to death. Some aneurysms cause no symptoms. You might not know you have an aneurysm even if it is large. Aneurysms can form in several parts of the body, including: The body's main artery, called the aorta (aortic aneurysm). The part of the aorta that passes through the belly area (abdominal aortic aneurysm). The part of the aorta that passes through the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm). Blood vessels that send blood to the brain (brain aneurysm). Blood vessels in other parts of the body, such as the legs, groin or neck (peripheral aneurysm). Some small aneurysms have a low risk of rupture. To determine the risk of an aneurysm rupture, a healthcare professional considers: Your symptoms. Your medical history. Your family's medical history. The size, shape and location of the aneurysm. Some people with aneurysms only need regular health checkups and imaging tests. If an aneurysm breaks open, emergency treatment is needed. Treatment may involve open surgery or a less-invasive treatment called endovascular surgery.","An aneurysm is a bulge or balloon-like area in a blood vessel. It can happen in different parts of the body, like the brain, chest, belly, or legs. If the aneurysm gets too big, it can burst and cause serious bleeding inside the body.
Some people don’t feel anything, even if the aneurysm is large. But if it bursts, it’s a medical emergency.
Doctors decide how risky it is based on its size, shape, and where it is in the body. Some aneurysms just need regular checkups, but others may need surgery or a less invasive procedure to fix them before they break open.",An aneurysm is a bulge or ballooning in the wall of a blood vessel.

Bell's palsy,"Bell's palsy is a condition that causes sudden weakness in the muscles on one side of the face. Often the weakness is short-term and improves over weeks. The weakness makes half of the face appear to droop. Smiles are one-sided, and the eye on the affected side is hard to close. Bell's palsy also is known as acute peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause. It can occur at any age. The exact cause is not known. Experts think it's caused by swelling and irritation of the nerve that controls the muscles on one side of the face. Bell's palsy could be caused by a reaction that occurs after a viral infection. Symptoms usually start to improve within a few weeks, with complete recovery in about six months. A small number of people continue to have some Bell's palsy symptoms for life. Rarely, Bell's palsy occurs more than once.","Bell’s palsy causes sudden weakness on one side of the face. This can make half of the face look droopy, and it might be hard to smile or close one eye.

bronchitis,"Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lining of your bronchial tubes. These tubes carry air to and from your lungs. People who have bronchitis often cough up thickened mucus, which can be discolored. Bronchitis may start suddenly and be short term (acute) or start gradually and become long term (chronic). Acute bronchitis, which often develops from a cold or other respiratory infection, is very common. Also called a chest cold, acute bronchitis usually improves within a week to 10 days without lasting effects, although the cough may linger for weeks. Chronic bronchitis, a more serious condition, is a constant irritation or inflammation of the lining of the bronchial tubes, often due to smoking. If you have repeated bouts of bronchitis, you may have chronic bronchitis, which requires medical attention. Chronic bronchitis is one of the conditions included in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).","Bronchitis is when the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs get swollen and irritated. This makes it harder to breathe and often causes a cough with thick mucus. It can be short-term (called acute bronchitis), which usually comes from a cold and gets better in about a week — though the cough may last longer.
Chronic bronchitis is more serious and lasts a long time. It’s often caused by smoking and can make breathing harder over time. People with repeated bronchitis may have a condition called COPD. Treatment depends on the type, but rest, fluids, and avoiding smoke can help.","Bronchitis is when your breathing tubes (called bronchial tubes) get inflamed. This is like when your eyes get red and itchy from a cold, except it's your breathing tubes.","- Coughing up thick mucus (phlegm) that may be green, yellow, or white

calciphylaxis,"Calciphylaxis (kal-sih-fuh-LAK-sis) is a rare, serious disease. It involves a buildup of calcium in small blood vessels of fat tissues and skin. Calciphylaxis symptoms include blood clots, lumps under the skin and painful open sores called ulcers. If an ulcer becomes infected, it can be life-threatening. The exact cause of calciphylaxis isn't clear. But people with the disease usually have kidney failure. That's a condition in which the kidneys no longer work as they should. Often, these same people also have received kidney failure treatments such as dialysis or a kidney transplant. Calciphylaxis can happen in people without kidney disease too. Calciphylaxis treatments include various medicines, procedures and surgery. Treatment can help prevent blood clots and infections, reduce calcium buildups, heal sores, and ease pain.","Calciphylaxis is a rare and serious condition where calcium builds up in small blood vessels in the skin and fat.

cataracts,"A cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye, which is typically clear. For people who have cataracts, seeing through cloudy lenses is like looking through a frosty or fogged-up window. Clouded vision caused by cataracts can make it more difficult to read, drive a car at night or see the expression on a friend's face. Most cataracts develop slowly and don't disturb eyesight early on. But with time, cataracts will eventually affect vision. At first, stronger lighting and eyeglasses can help deal with cataracts. But if impaired vision affects usual activities, cataract surgery might be needed. Fortunately, cataract surgery is generally a safe, effective procedure.","A cataract is when the clear lens in your eye becomes cloudy, like looking through a foggy window. This can make it harder to read, drive at night, or see faces clearly. Cataracts often develop slowly and may not affect your vision at first.

diabetes,"Diabetes mellitus refers to a group of diseases that affect how the body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is an important source of energy for the cells that make up the muscles and tissues. It's also the brain's main source of fuel. The main cause of diabetes varies by type. But no matter what type of diabetes you have, it can lead to excess sugar in the blood. Too much sugar in the blood can lead to serious health problems. Chronic diabetes conditions include type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Potentially reversible diabetes conditions include prediabetes and gestational diabetes. Prediabetes happens when blood sugar levels are higher than normal. But the blood sugar levels aren't high enough to be called diabetes. And prediabetes can lead to diabetes unless steps are taken to prevent it. Gestational diabetes happens during pregnancy. But it may go away after the baby is born.","Diabetes is a group of conditions that affect how your body uses blood sugar (glucose). Glucose is your body’s main source of energy, especially for the muscles and brain. In diabetes, sugar builds up in the blood because the body doesn’t make or use insulin properly.

Endocarditis,"Endocarditis is a life-threatening inflammation of the inner lining of the heart's chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium. Endocarditis is usually caused by an infection. Bacteria, fungi or other germs get into the bloodstream and attach to damaged areas in the heart. Things that make you more likely to get endocarditis are artificial heart valves, damaged heart valves or other heart defects. Without quick treatment, endocarditis can damage or destroy the heart valves. Treatments for endocarditis include medications and surgery. Endocarditis occurs when bacteria or other germs enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. The germs then stick to damaged heart valves or damaged heart tissue.","Endocarditis is a serious infection of the inside lining of the heart and its valves.

Fibromyalgia,"Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition that involves widespread body pain. The pain happens along with fatigue. It also can involve issues with sleep, memory and mood. Researchers think that fibromyalgia affects the way the brain and spinal cord process painful and nonpainful signals. That increases your overall sensitivity to pain. Symptoms often start after a triggering event. Triggers can include injuries, surgery, infections or emotional stress. Or the symptoms can build up over time, with no single event to trigger them. Women are more likely to get fibromyalgia than are men. Many people who have fibromyalgia also have: Headaches. Jaw and facial pain due to temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disorders.

Glaucoma,"Glaucoma is an eye condition that damages the optic nerve. This damage can lead to vision loss or blindness. The optic nerve sends visual information from your eye to the brain and is vital for good vision. Damage to the optic nerve is often related to high pressure in the eye. But glaucoma can happen even with typical eye pressure. Glaucoma can happen at any age but is more common in older adults. It is one of the leading causes of blindness for people over the age of 60. Many forms of glaucoma have no warning signs. The effect is so gradual that you may not notice a change in vision until the condition is in its later stages. It's important to have regular eye exams that include measurements of your eye pressure. If glaucoma is found early, vision loss can be slowed or prevented. If you have glaucoma, you'll need treatment or monitoring for the rest of your life.","Glaucoma is an eye disease that damages the optic nerve, which carries signals from your eyes to your brain.

Hashimoto's disease,"Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting the thyroid gland. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located at the base of the neck just below the Adam's apple. The thyroid produces hormones that help regulate many functions in the body. An autoimmune disorder is an illness caused by the immune system attacking healthy tissues. In Hashimoto's disease, immune-system cells lead to the death of the thyroid's hormone-producing cells. The disease usually results in a decline in hormone production (hypothyroidism). Although anyone can develop Hashimoto's disease, it's most common among middle-aged women. The primary treatment is thyroid hormone replacement. Hashimoto's disease is also known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis.","Hashimoto’s disease is an autoimmune condition that affects the thyroid, a gland in the neck that helps control energy and other body functions.

Keratoconus,"Keratoconus (ker-uh-toe-KOH-nus) is an eye condition in which the clear, dome-shaped front of the eye, called the cornea, gets thinner, steeper and bulges outward into a cone shape. A cone-shaped cornea causes blurred vision and may cause sensitivity to light and glare. Keratoconus usually affects both eyes. However, it can affect one eye more than the other. It generally begins to affect people between the late teens and 30 years of age. The condition may progress slowly for 10 years or longer. In the early stages of keratoconus, you might be able to correct vision problems with glasses or soft contact lenses. Later, you may have to be fitted with rigid, gas permeable contact lenses or other types of lenses, such as scleral lenses. If your condition gets worse, you may need a cornea transplant. A procedure called corneal collagen cross-linking may help to slow or stop keratoconus from progressing, possibly preventing the need for a future cornea transplant.

This causes blurry vision and sensitivity to light.
It usually starts between the late teens and early 30s and may get worse over 10 years or more. Glasses or soft lenses may help early on, but many people need special hard lenses as the condition gets worse.
In more serious cases, a cornea transplant may be needed. A procedure called corneal cross-linking can also help slow or stop the condition from getting worse.","---

 Keratoconus is when the clear, dome-shaped part of your eye gets thinner and flatter, and can't see well. It's like a mushroom on your eye that's too big.","- Blurry vision

Klinefelter syndrome,"Klinefelter syndrome is a common condition that results when a person assigned male at birth has an extra copy of the X sex chromosome instead of the typical XY. Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that occurs before birth, but it often isn't diagnosed until adulthood. Klinefelter syndrome may affect testicular growth. This results in smaller testicles, which can lead to making less of the hormone testosterone. The syndrome also may cause smaller muscle mass, less body and facial hair, and extra breast tissue. The effects of Klinefelter syndrome vary, and not everyone has the same symptoms. Most people with Klinefelter syndrome produce little or no sperm, but assisted reproductive procedures may make it possible for some people with Klinefelter syndrome to have biological children.","Klinefelter syndrome is a genetic condition that happens when someone assigned male at birth has an extra X chromosome. This affects how the body grows and develops, especially in puberty. It may cause smaller testicles, lower testosterone levels, and changes like less facial hair or more breast tissue.

Laryngitis,"Laryngitis is an inflammation of your voice box (larynx) from overuse, irritation or infection. Inside the larynx are your vocal cords — two folds of mucous membrane covering muscle and cartilage. Normally, your vocal cords open and close smoothly, forming sounds through their movement and vibration. How speech occurs Speech occurs when air flows from the lungs, up the windpipe (trachea) and through the voice box (larynx). This causes the vocal cords to vibrate, creating sound. Sound is shaped into words by the muscles controlling the soft palate, tongue and lips. Vocal cords open and closed Vocal cords open when you breathe and then close to produce sound when vibrating together. But with laryngitis, your vocal cords become inflamed or irritated. This makes the vocal cords swell, which distorts the sounds produced by air passing over them. As a result, your voice sounds hoarse. In some cases of laryngitis, your voice can become almost undetectable. Laryngitis may be short-lived (acute) or long lasting (chronic). Most cases of laryngitis are triggered by a temporary viral infection and aren't serious. Persistent hoarseness can sometimes signal a more serious underlying medical condition.","Laryngitis is when the voice box (larynx) gets swollen, usually from overuse, a cold, or irritation. The vocal cords inside the larynx help you speak by vibrating when air passes over them. When they’re swollen, your voice may sound hoarse or even disappear.
Laryngitis can be short-term (from a virus) or long-lasting (from smoking or overuse). Most cases go away on their own in a few days.
If hoarseness lasts a long time, it could be a sign of another problem and should be checked by a doctor.","---

 Laryngitis is when your voice box (larynx) gets inflamed or irritated. This can happen because you talk too much, smoke, or get a virus. It can also happen because of allergies or cancer.","- **Hoarse voice:** Your voice may sound rough or strained when you talk.

Leukemia,"Leukemia is cancer of the body's blood-forming tissues, including the bone marrow and the lymphatic system. Many types of leukemia exist. Some forms of leukemia are more common in children. Other forms of leukemia occur mostly in adults. Leukemia usually involves the white blood cells. Your white blood cells are potent infection fighters — they normally grow and divide in an orderly way, as your body needs them. But in people with leukemia, the bone marrow produces an excessive amount of abnormal white blood cells, which don't function properly. Treatment for leukemia can be complex — depending on the type of leukemia and other factors. But there are strategies and resources that can help make your treatment successful.","Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects how your body makes blood, especially white blood cells. In leukemia, the body makes too many abnormal white blood cells that don’t work the way they should.
There are different types, some more common in children and others in adults.

Term: Asthma
Description: Asthma is a lung condition that causes symptoms like wheezing, coughing, and difficulty breathing. It can happen when your airways get narrow, which makes it harder for you to breathe air in and out. Asthma is a chronic condition, meaning it lasts for a long time. It can be caused by different things, like allergens or irritants in the air. There are different types of asthma, and each person's experience with it can be different.

Malaria,"Malaria is a disease caused by a parasite. The parasite is spread to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes. People who have malaria usually feel very sick with a high fever and shaking chills. While the disease is uncommon in temperate climates, malaria is still common in tropical and subtropical countries. Each year nearly 290 million people are infected with malaria, and more than 400,000 people die of the disease. To reduce malaria infections, world health programs distribute preventive drugs and insecticide-treated bed nets to protect people from mosquito bites. The World Health Organization has recommended a malaria vaccine for use in children who live in countries with high numbers of malaria cases. Protective clothing, bed nets and insecticides can protect you while traveling. You also can take preventive medicine before, during and after a trip to a high-risk area. Many malaria parasites have developed resistance to common drugs used to treat the disease.","Malaria is a serious disease caused by a parasite that spreads through the bite of an infected mosquito. It causes high fever, chills, and feeling very sick.
Malaria is rare in places like the U.S. but still common in many tropical countries. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people die from it.
You can help prevent malaria by using bug spray, bed nets, and taking preventive medicine when traveling to high-risk areas. There’s also a vaccine for young children in high-risk regions. Treatment is available, but some forms of malaria are harder to treat due to drug resistance.","Malaria is a sickness that can happen if a tiny bug called a parasite gets into your body. This happens when you get bitten by a mosquito that has the parasite on it. Most people who get malaria feel very sick, with a high fever and shaking chills.

Measles,"Measles, also called rubeola, was once a common childhood illness. It's caused by a virus that spreads easily through the air and settles on surfaces. A vaccine can prevent measles infection. Most people recover from measles in about 10 days. It usually doesn't cause long-term medical issues. But measles can be serious and even deadly. This is especially true for children younger than age 5 and people with severely weakened immune systems. Measles is treated by managing symptoms and preventing complications. Get a measles vaccine when recommended to keep the virus from spreading. Because of vaccination, measles hasn't been common in the United States for more than two decades. Often, measles cases in the U.S. come from outside the country. Outbreaks are more common among people who are not vaccinated. Measles illness causes a blotchy rash. It may be shades of red, purple or brown depending on your skin color. The rash most often shows up first on the face and behind the ears. The rash then spreads to the chest and back and finally to the feet.","Measles is a viral infection that spreads easily through the air and on surfaces. It usually starts with a fever and cough, followed by a blotchy rash that spreads from the face to the rest of the body.
Most people recover in about 10 days, but it can be dangerous — especially for young children and people with weak immune systems.
There is no cure, but symptoms can be managed. The measles vaccine is very effective at preventing the disease and has made it rare in many countries. Outbreaks mostly happen in areas with low vaccination rates.","---

Nearsightedness,"Nearsightedness is a common vision condition in which close objects look clear but far objects look blurry. The medical term for nearsightedness is myopia. Myopia happens when the shape of the eye — or the shape of certain parts of the eye — causes light rays to bend or refract. Light rays that should be focused on nerve tissues at the back of the eye, called the retina, are focused in front of the retina instead. Nearsightedness usually develops during childhood and adolescence. Typically, it becomes more stable between the ages of 20 and 40. It tends to run in families. A basic eye exam can confirm nearsightedness. You can correct the blurry vision with eyeglasses, contact lenses or refractive surgery.","Nearsightedness, or myopia, is a vision problem where you can see things up close clearly, but things far away look blurry. It happens when the eye’s shape causes light to focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it.

Neuroblastoma,"Neuroblastoma is a cancer that starts in cells called neuroblasts. Neuroblasts are immature nerve cells. They are found in several areas of the body. Neuroblastoma most often starts in the neuroblasts in the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney. The glands make hormones that control important functions in the body. Other parts of the body that have neuroblasts and can get neuroblastoma include the spine, belly, chest and neck. Neuroblastoma usually affects children age 5 or younger. Symptoms vary, depending on where it occurs in the body. Some forms of neuroblastoma may go away on their own. Other forms of neuroblastoma need treatment. Treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and bone marrow transplant. Your child's healthcare team will select the neuroblastoma treatments that are best for your child.","Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that starts in immature nerve cells called neuroblasts. It usually begins in the adrenal glands, which sit on top of the kidneys, but it can also appear in the chest, belly, spine, or neck.

Oligodendroglioma,"Oligodendroglioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The growth, called a tumor, begins in cells called oligodendrocytes. These cells make a substance that protects nerve cells and helps with the flow of electrical signals in the brain and spinal cord. Oligodendroglioma is most common in adults, but it can happen at any age. Symptoms include seizures, headaches, and weakness or disability in a part of the body. Where this happens in the body depends on which parts of the brain or spinal cord are affected by the tumor. Treatment is with surgery, when possible. Sometimes surgery can't be done if the tumor is in a place that makes it hard to reach with surgical tools. Other treatments may be needed if the tumor can't be removed or if it's likely to come back after surgery.","Oligodendroglioma is a brain or spinal cord tumor that starts in cells called oligodendrocytes. These cells help protect nerve signals in the brain and spinal cord.

Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting millions of people worldwide. It happens when the protective cartilage that cushions the ends of the bones wears down over time. Although osteoarthritis can damage any joint, the condition most commonly affects joints in the hands, knees, hips and spine. Osteoarthritis symptoms can usually be managed, although the damage to joints can't be reversed. Staying active, maintaining a healthy weight and receiving certain treatments might slow progression of the disease and help improve pain and joint function.","Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis. It happens when the cartilage that cushions your joints wears down over time. This can cause pain, stiffness, and make it harder to move.

Pancreatitis,"Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. Inflammation is immune system activity that can cause swelling, pain, and changes in how an organ or tissues work. The pancreas is a long, flat gland that's tucked behind the stomach. The pancreas helps the body digest food and regulates blood sugars. Pancreatitis can be an acute condition. This means it appears suddenly and generally lasts a short time. Chronic pancreatitis is a long-term condition. The damage to the pancreas can get worse over time. Acute pancreatitis may improve on its own. More-serious disease requires treatment in a hospital and can cause life-threatening complications.","Pancreatitis is when the pancreas becomes swollen and painful.

Parkinson's disease,"Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder of the nervous system that worsens over time. The nervous system is a network of nerve cells that controls many parts of the body, including movement. Symptoms start slowly. The first symptom may be a barely noticeable tremor in just one hand or sometimes a foot or the jaw. Tremor is common in Parkinson's disease. But the disorder also may cause stiffness, slowing of movement and trouble with balance that raises the risk of falls. In the early stages of Parkinson's disease, your face may show little or no expression. Your arms may not swing when you walk. Your speech may become soft or slurred. Symptoms get worse over time. Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medicines may help symptoms get better. Sometimes a healthcare professional may suggest surgery to help control parts of the brain. This surgery may help lessen symptoms.","Parkinson’s disease is a nervous system disorder that affects movement.

Renal artery stenosis,Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of one or more arteries that carry blood to your kidneys (renal arteries). Narrowing of the arteries prevents enough oxygen-rich blood from reaching your kidneys. Your kidneys need adequate blood flow to help filter waste products and remove excess fluids. Reduced blood flow to your kidneys may injure kidney tissue and increase blood pressure throughout your body.,"Renal artery stenosis is when the arteries that bring blood to your kidneys become too narrow. This means the kidneys don’t get enough blood and can’t work properly.
It can lead to kidney damage and high blood pressure. If not treated, the kidneys can become injured.
Treatment may involve medications, lifestyle changes, or sometimes procedures to open the narrowed arteries.","This condition happens when the arteries that bring blood to your kidneys get narrower. It's like if the main road to your park got blocked by a fallen tree. The tree (or in this case, the blockage) makes it harder for cars to get through.","- High blood pressure

Scoliosis,"Scoliosis is a side-to-side curve of the spine. It's most often diagnosed after age 10 or in the early teen years. The spine can curve to either side and in different parts of the back. Experts don't know the cause of most childhood scoliosis. Most scoliosis is mild. But some curves get worse as children grow. If the curve gets very bad, scoliosis can cause pain and breathing problems. A bad curve of the spine can push on the lungs and make it hard to breathe. Healthcare professionals watch growing children who have mild scoliosis with follow-up visits a few times a year. This most often involves X-rays and a physical exam to see if the curve is getting worse. Many people with scoliosis don't need treatment. Some children may need to wear a brace to stop the curve from getting worse. Others may need surgery to correct the curves.","Scoliosis is when the spine curves sideways, usually in the upper or lower back. It’s most often found in kids or teens after age 10.

Tay-Sachs disease,"Tay-Sachs disease is a rare genetic disorder passed from parents to child. It's caused by the absence of an enzyme that helps break down fatty substances. These fatty substances, called gangliosides, build up to toxic levels in the brain and spinal cord and affect the function of the nerve cells. In the most common and severe form of Tay-Sachs disease, signs and symptoms start to show up at about 3 to 6 months of age. As the disease progresses, development slows and muscles begin to weaken. Over time, this leads to seizures, vision and hearing loss, paralysis, and other major issues. Children with this form of Tay-Sachs disease typically live only a few years. Less commonly, some children have the juvenile form of Tay-Sachs disease and may live into their teen years. Rarely, some adults have a late-onset form of Tay-Sachs disease which is often less severe than forms that begin in childhood. If you have a family history of Tay-Sachs disease or if you're a member of a high-risk group and plan to have children, health care providers strongly recommend genetic testing and genetic counseling.","Tay-Sachs is a rare genetic disorder that mostly affects babies. It’s caused by a missing enzyme that normally breaks down fatty substances in the brain and spinal cord. Without it, these substances build up and cause serious brain damage.

Ventricular fibrillation,"Ventricular fibrillation is a type of irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia). During ventricular fibrillation, the lower heart chambers contract in a very rapid and uncoordinated manner. As a result, the heart doesn't pump blood to the rest of the body. Ventricular fibrillation is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention. It's the most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death. Emergency treatment for ventricular fibrillation includes cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shocks to the heart with a device called an automated external defibrillator (AED). Medications, implanted devices or surgery may be recommended to prevent episodes of ventricular fibrillation.

Vasculitis,"Vasculitis involves swelling and irritation, called inflammation, of blood vessels. The inflammation can cause the walls of the blood vessels to thicken. This thickening can narrow the vessels. If the narrowing restricts blood flow, it can damage organs and tissues. There are many types of vasculitis. Most of them are rare. Vasculitis might affect just one organ or several. The condition can be short-term or long lasting. Vasculitis can affect anyone. But some types are more common among people in certain age groups. Some types may improve without treatment. Most types need treatment with medicines to control the inflammation and prevent flares.","Vasculitis is when the blood vessels get inflamed, which can cause the walls to thicken and narrow. This reduces blood flow and can damage organs and tissues.

Today, whooping cough mainly affects children too young to have gotten all their shots of the vaccine. The illness also tends to affect teenagers and adults whose protection from the vaccine has faded. Deaths linked with whooping cough are rare. Most often, they occur in infants. But pregnant people can help protect their babies by getting a booster shot of the vaccine during pregnancy. Vaccination also is recommended for other people who will have close contact with an infant.","Whooping cough is a bacterial illness that causes a strong cough followed by a high-pitched “whoop” sound when breathing in.

Wilson's disease,"Wilson's disease is a rare inherited condition that causes copper levels to build up in several organs, especially the liver, brain and eyes. Most people with Wilson's disease are diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 35. But younger and older people can be affected too. Copper plays a key role in building healthy nerves, bones, collagen and the skin pigment melanin. You usually take in copper from the food you eat. Your liver produces a substance called bile that removes any extra copper. But in people with Wilson's disease, copper isn't removed properly and instead builds up. Sometimes it can be life-threatening if it's not treated. When diagnosed early, Wilson's disease is treatable, and many people with the condition live normal lives.","Wilson’s disease is a rare condition that causes too much copper to build up in the body. It mainly affects the liver, brain, and eyes.
Normally, the liver removes extra copper, but in this condition, it doesn’t work properly.

Addison's disease,"Addison's disease is a rare condition that happens when the body doesn't make enough of some hormones. Another name for Addison's disease is primary adrenal insufficiency. With Addison's disease, the adrenal glands make too little of the hormone cortisol. Often, they also make too little of another hormone called aldosterone. Damage to the adrenal glands causes Addison's disease. Symptoms can start slowly. Early symptoms may include extreme tiredness, salt cravings and weight loss. Addison's disease can affect anyone. Without treatment, it can be life-threatening. Treatment involves taking lab-made hormones to replace those that are missing.","Addison’s disease happens when the body doesn’t make enough important hormones, like cortisol and aldosterone.
These hormones help control energy, blood pressure, and the balance of salt and water.

Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy is a group of conditions that affect movement and posture. It's caused by damage that occurs to the developing brain, most often before birth. Symptoms appear during infancy or preschool years and vary from very mild to serious. Children with cerebral palsy may have exaggerated reflexes. The arms, legs and trunk may appear floppy. Or they may have stiff muscles, known as spasticity. Symptoms also can include irregular posture, movements that can't be controlled, a walk that's not steady or some combination of these. Cerebral palsy may make it hard to swallow. It also can cause eye muscle imbalance, in which the eyes don't focus on the same object. People with the condition might have reduced range of motion in their joints due to muscle stiffness. The cause of cerebral palsy and its effect on function vary from person to person. Some people with cerebral palsy can walk while others need assistance. Some people have intellectual disabilities, but others do not. Epilepsy, blindness or deafness also might affect some people with cerebral palsy. There is no cure, but treatments can help improve function.
